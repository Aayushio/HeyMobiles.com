        Realme made an unexpected announcement in October, confirming that the Realme GT 7 Pro will be the first device to launch with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset in India. The phone is launching in China on November 4th and will make its debut in the country shortly after in the same month.

The Realme GT 7 Pro is turning out to be more impressive than we thought, thanks to new teasers published by the brand’s official page on Weibo. Here are some new details about Realme’s upcoming flagship offering and its camera prowess.

    <h2>Realme GT 7 Pro telephoto camera features</h2>
    <p>Most flagship smartphones being launched this year feature a periscope telephoto camera, but Realme is taking things a step further with the Realme GT 7 Pro. Based on teaser images shared on Chinese social media, the device will come with an underwater photography mode. This was hinted when an underwater unboxing video of the phone emerged a couple of days ago.
        <br><br>
        The device will support fingerprint unlocking underwater and directly opening the camera app post-unlock. You will be able to click shots from both the rear and the front camera and also be able to zoom in. It will also automatically eject water to protect the device from water damage. That’s not all, the brand claims that the Realme GT 7 Pro will also feature an AI DMotion algorithm to capture moving moments at a 1/1,000th of a second speed.
        <br><br>
        Realme shared multiple camera samples to support these claims. Realme GT 7 Pro is confirmed to feature a 3X optical zoom, 6X lossless zoom and up to 120X digital zoom through its Telephoto camera. The three-fold periscope module is now thinner and yet clearer than its predecessor.
