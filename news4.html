        OnePlus is all set to launch its latest flagship phone, the OnePlus 13, later today. Ahead of the launch event, the pricing of the upcoming phone has leaked on Chinese social media. The leak indicates that the OnePlus 13 could face a slight price hike compared to its predecessor. Here is what you need to know.
    </p>
    <h2>OnePlus 13 pricing leaked for the Chinese market</h2>
    <p>It seems like the OnePlus 13 pricing in China has been leaked from retail store units. The image, shared by a Chinese news website, Fast Technology, has revealed that the OnePlus 13 could start at a price tag of RMB 4,799 (Rs. 56,700 in Indian Rupees or $675) for the base 12/256GB variant. To recall, the OnePlus 12 started at a price tag of RMB 4,299 (Rs. 50,700) in its domestic market.
        <br><br>
        This RMB 500 increase could mean that the phone will be pricier even in global markets in India. This is not the only Snapdragon 8 Elite device featuring a price hike, as this weekâ€™s Xiaomi 15 launch had a similar increase.
        <br><br>
        OnePlus 13 will come in a total of 4 storage variants based on this leak. For the 12/512GB variant, the device will cost RMB 5,299. The 16GB/512GB will set customers back at RMB 5,799, while the top-end 24GB RAM variant with 1TB storage will cost RMB 6,299. Here are the leaked specifications of the upcoming OnePlus 13.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Processor: </b>The phone is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC.</li>
        <li><b>Display: </b>6.82-inch AMOLED display with 2K resolution</li>
        <li><b>Battery: </b>A 6,000mAh battery pack will be supported by 100W wired charging and 50W wireless charging.</li>

        <li><b>Others: </b>The device will feature an IP69 rating and a new Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor.</li>
