        OnePlus has launched its latest flagship device, the OnePlus 13, in China. The device features some much-awaited upgrades and the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset by Qualcomm. Thanks to its refined design language and a new quad-curved display panel, the phone looks even more premium than before. But here’s all you need to know about its specifications and the pricing in the company’s domestic market.
    </p>
    <h2>OnePlus 13 price, availability</h2>
    <p>
        OnePlus 13 costs slightly more than its predecessor in China. To recall, the OnePlus 12 started at RMB 4,299 (Rs. 50,700), and the new starting price is just RMB 200 more than earlier.
        <br><br>
        The device will go on sale in China starting November 1st. It’s available in three colour options: a blue colour with a vegan leather back, a white colour with a matte glass back and a black colour with wood-textured glass.
    </p>
    <h2>OnePlus 13 specifications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Display: </b>The device features a 6.82-inch 2K resolution, LTPO AMOLED display with a peak local brightness of 4,500 nits. It has a DisplayMate A++ certification for excellent quality and brightness.</li>
        <li><b>Performance: </b>OnePlus 13 is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which features Oryon cores and reaches a score of over 3.1 lakh on AnTuTu with its max 4.32GHz clock speed. It also features LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 ROM. A 9,925mm2 vapour chamber is present for better thermals. </li>
        <li><b>Camera: </b>In terms of cameras, the OnePlus features a 50MP Sony LYT-808 main camera sensor with OIS and support for 8K recording, a 50MP periscope camera with 3X optical zoom and a 50MP ultrawide angle camera. A 32MP camera is present on the front for selfies.</li>
        <li><b>Battery: </b>The phone is packed with a 6,000mAh battery that can fully charge in 36 minutes with 100W wired charging. OnePlus 13 also supports 50W wireless charging.</li>
        <li><b>Others: </b>The device has an IP69 rating to protect against high-pressure water impact. An ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is present for faster and more reliable recognition.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        OnePlus 13: What’s new?
    </h2>
    <p>The biggest upgrade in the OnePlus 13 and most Android flagships launching soon is the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. In terms of raw performance and benchmarks, this chipset has even surpassed Apple’s A18 Pro SoC. However, we’ve yet to see how much of a difference it will make in real-world usage.
        <br><br>
        OnePlus 13 is finally moving away from a curved display and option for a 2.5 quad-curved panel. It is also lighter and thinner than before. The panel is now higher quality and brighter than its precedssor with DisplayMate A++ certification.
        <br><br>
        The device also features a significantly bigger battery at 6,000 mAh, up from 5,400 mAh on the OnePlus 12. OnePlus has also introduced a larger vapour chamber cooling system to maintain temperatures with a faster processor.
        <br><br>
        If OnePlus follows its usual timeline, we could see the launch of the OnePlus 13 in global markets such as India early next year. We expect the device to feature the same internals as the Chinese variant, but it will come with OxygenOS 15, based on Android 15, internationally. It could be more expensive than the OnePlus 12 even in global markets, considering the slightly higher price tag in China.
